I am not a real photographer, but I&rsquo;ve always kept a semi-professional camera around.
I started from a Pentax ME Super:<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_1.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>Pentax ME Super is a pretty good representation of the film era. Aperture priority metering, manual shutter, etc. It gave me a crash course of photography.
You have to be sure of every shutter release because, unlike what people had been saying, film ain&rsquo;t cheap, especially for a young kid like me.
I couldn&rsquo;t really afford (or justify the cost to my parents) to have the film processed and printed, so I learnt to process black and white slides myself.
I bought a cheapo russian projector and view my processed film this way.</p><p><strong>IT WAS WAY TOO HIP FOR THE MODERN DAY ME THOUGH:</strong><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_3.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_4.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_5.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Then I had enough of the crap about film. I was always guessing, always paying for the stupid lab&hellip; so I moved to Pentax K-10D,
it was the only DSLR that I can afford on the used market (I think this was 2012, so yeah, I ain&rsquo;t rich)<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_2.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>I kept my film lense for the camera, since I can&rsquo;t afford to purchase a digital lens. Pentax digital cameras worked really well with their old lenses.
I was able to shoot with manual focusing and aperture priority pretty easily, even as a beginner digital photographer.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_6.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_7.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>After which, I found a part-time job in my college and was able to afford the proper equipment, a Pentax K-5 with a couple of proper digital lenses.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_8.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>I owned K-5 for a while. It is a great camera and even today&rsquo;s camera is not that better than it, a lot of good photos were taken with the setup.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_9.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_10.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_11.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>During the K-5 ownership I stopped to see too much of an improvement in my photos. Slowly, the <strong>hunt of photo op</strong> becomes more of a issue than actually taking the photo properly.
K-5 and the DSLR setup&rsquo;s weight became a huge problem. Heavy equipment simply makes my trip less enjoyable as an unprofessional photographer.
Taking photos is only a small part of traveling for me. So I gradually stopped taking my cameras for trips. And the camera starts to collect dust.</p><p>But there is hope, the hope is from <strong>SONY</strong>, my next camera is the Sony Alpha α6000<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_12.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>I don&rsquo;t see much of a functional difference between the Sony and K-5, the Sony is simply lighter and smaller. Takeing it on a trip is a breeze, and the Sony sensor is simply impressive.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_13.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_14.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_15.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_23.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Again, quite some time has passed and then, <strong>I GOT A JOB!</strong> The poor student is gone and I get to buy pretty much any camera I want if I try to spend some time to save. In the meantime, Pentax made the famous K-1, so I bought one.
That marks my first ever Full-frame camera.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_16.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>I also got a proper lens to go along with it, the FA 31 Limited. (Obviously I have other lenses too, this one is just too pretty)<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_17.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Full-frame cameras are just simply better than APS-C cameras because of the color rendering, low ISO noise, and beautiful bokeh. Most importantly, the separation of the object and background, even at distance.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_18.jpg alt="click to zoom for the separation effect" class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption>click to zoom for the separation effect</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_19.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_20.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>But, it still has the same problem as the K-5. It is simply too heavy and too bulky.</p><p>Why not the Sony A7 series you ask? Because even though the camera body is small, the lenses are huge and heavy, making the concept useless in my eyes.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_21.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>The weight and bulk kept troubling my mind during my ownership of K-1. With the improvements of smartphone cameras
I often &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to bring the K-1, going on a trip with just my smartphone. I sometimes would think that it would be nice if a certain photo is taken with the K-1.
But I quickly forget it because it just doesn&rsquo;t seem worth it to me to bring the whole setup for this one photo op.</p><p>Things can get even worse&hellip; The new dual/quad camera smartphones basically make APS-C cameras useless.
I personally believe bokeh is the only advantage of a APS-C camera over a high quality smartphone and digital bokeh killed that one thing.
With a little digital processing, compression, I don&rsquo;t think you can tell much of a difference&hellip; For example, one of the a6000 photos is actually taken with an iPhone X&hellip; Sorry I tricked you.</p><p>I can still argue that full frame cameras have a place in the modern days because of the low light ability, natural color rendering, and object separation.
Digital processing is still noticeable in some places, a good lens and good sensor still beat it.</p><p>Well there is hope for Cameras, the hope is from <strong>SONY</strong>, again, so I sold my K-1 and got my next camera. The Sony RX1R<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_22.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>It is basically a combination of a Sony A7 with an excellent Zeiss Lens. It is very small and light, I would happily bring it on a trip and use it for the few photo ops that I would like to see in a better image quality.<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_24.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_25.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_26.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>THAT BEING SAID&hellip; I have only used it on 1 trip since I bought it, a 7-day-long trip. Because after all, the camera is an extra thing to worry about,
an extra item to carry, something that doesn&rsquo;t comfortably sit in a pocket. The camera on the smartphone is just too convenient and too addictive. Sometimes, even the need
to transfer photos from the camera to the smartphone becomes a justification for not using the camera.</p><p>But I would probably keep the camera, it is non intrusive enough, but it would be one of the first things I would sell if I ever need money.</p><p><strong>So&hellip; what is the future then?</strong> Well, There is no future.</p><p>Smartphone cameras will replace semi-pro digital cameras. Sorry, I wasted your time. LOL.</p><p>Okay, seriously, I thought a compact camera with good zooming ability, like the Sony RX100VI, will become the next camera I buy. But then, Huawei made the P30 Pro with 50X Zoom&hellip;<figure><img src=/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=/images/digital_camera_27.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure>So yeah, no future</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
