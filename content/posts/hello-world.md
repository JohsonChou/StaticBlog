I've finally decided to spin up another personal blog. Hopefully this one last longer... It does have the latest tech. It is completely static and served over CloudFront from a S3 bucket (Yes, I still need to pay for it).

Since it is a **personal** blog, and me being me, this blog is gonna be totally random. There is gonna be Code, Photography, Politics, 3D Printer, Hardware... I mean, **hopefully** there is gonna be Code, Photography, Politics, 3D Printer, Hardware... I am lazy "turbulent", according to the totally accurate 13 personalities thing, there is some possibility that this could be my last post here. I mean we are talking about me here.

Peace.
