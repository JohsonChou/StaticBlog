Existing dog trackers either don't do real time GPS tracking or calls for an expensive subscription, here are some examples:

* [Whistle 3](https://www.amazon.com/Whistle-GPS-Tracker-Activity-Monitor/dp/B01N7MWKWY/)
  * Real-time tracking with GPS and LTE
  * Device Cost $78.99
  * Monthly $9.99 or $167 for 2 years
* [Findster Duo+](https://www.amazon.com/Findster-Tracker-Free-Monthly-Fees/dp/B07FFCRQHN)
  * GPS tracking, only 3 mile range in open field
  * Device Cost $149.99
  * No subscription needed
* [Bartun Mini GPS Tracker](https://www.amazon.com/Bartun-Waterproof-Locating-Positioning-Geo-Fence/)
  * Real-time tracking with GPS and SMS/2G
  * Device Cost $45.99
  * Provide your own SIM Card

The one that meets my requirements, the **Whistle 3**, would cost me around $78.99 + $7 per month, which is around **$160** for the first year. It seems a bit too much. However, I always want to get my dog a tracker, since he has quite a bad rep about bolting. With me working, He has to stay home alone most of the day, any person can accidentally let him out.

By chance, I found this: [Samsung SmartThings Tracker](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-SM-V110AZWAATT-Tracker-Tracking). It has all the feature of the Whistle 3 in terms of tracking, but cost just **$79.99** for the first year and **$50** for the subsequent years.
However, there isn't an existing dog collar mount for it. Using a key ring is also out of question since Samsung managed to make the hole on the tracker very very small:

I initially simply tied it to my dog's collar with a string, but charging it became a problem since it is difficult to remove. No solution is available online so I decided to make one with my 3D printers:

I put a cut out on the side to improve material efficiency while making easier to remove for charging. You don't need support for the cut out since it is diamond shaped. To secure the tracker in place, I took advantage of the curved edges and made the ring hole structure intruding from the side. My dog plays quite rough and hasn't managed to get it out.
